# Conn-Housing
MAP 673 Final Project
BY Joyia Williams

Original Proposal:

Affordable Housing on Connecticut

A map based on towns in Connecticut showing statistics for Affordable Housing from 2011 to 2016. An undergraduate student would like to see whether the amount of available housing has increased or decreased over a five year period.

VS Code, QGIS flat flies JQuery, Papa Parse D3

Data.gov local government data

    slider UI to be able to shift through different years
    User will be able to hover their mouse and see diferent town names

Will be hosted on github/ Github pages

Conclusion:
The project isn't quite were I wanted it to be. I didn't end up using the Papa parse and had some difficulty with the more ineractive features.  I know coding and map-making is a constant learning experience hence there is always an opportunity for improvement. I encountered a lot of new obstacles and fixes while working on this and I hope to take this experience be a better map maker and programmer.
